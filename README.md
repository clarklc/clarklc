Hi, Welcome to my Github! I’m Lewis Clark, and am 21 years old from Dundee, Scotland!
I am currently studying Game Development and Design, while working on personal Projects.
With a passion for music and creativity, I hope to combine these talents into a game project in the future...
I also am working on my pixel art, creating characters for personal projects (both 2D and 3D).

I can be contacted at lewiscameronclark@gmail.com
